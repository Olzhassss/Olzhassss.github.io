Now, with Haise near death, Ken wants to try dying heroically again, and Haise drearily accepts the fact that, after all, he was just “a pleasant dream” covering multiple trauma; thus Haise Sasaki becomes Ken Kaneki again. Aside from surprising the readers, the author wanted readers to feel: Haise, a distinct personality, finally giving up oneself – being merged and, therefore, killed; and Ken, ultimately, returning consciousness with entirety of his dire past but in robust conviction.

Audience – the readers of this manga – were expected to become more aware of these characters, feel more of their pain (actually, there’s just more and more pain to feel in this tragedy up until the end), be intrigued and influenced by characters’ explicit and implicit feelings. For example, readers are shown Kanae, at last, openly expressing her obsession and devotion to Shu through her (partly driven by Eto’s torture) vigorous impulsiveness and hate. Koori always looked like emotionless but, apparently, actually had affection and felt pain after found Hairu dead. Ken Kaneki reveals to himself that the mother he said to deeply care for actually abused him, but he used to block this memories. To make the effect, the visual narration must be profoundly expressive but not overwhelming. Furthermore, readers were supposed to understand that Ken’s true intentions in the final battle of Tokyo Ghoul was to die, heroically. Now, with Haise near death, Ken wants to try dying heroically again, and Haise drearily accepts the fact that, after all, he was just “a pleasant dream” covering multiple trauma; thus Haise Sasaki becomes Ken Kaneki again. Aside from surprising the readers, the author wanted readers to feel: Haise, a distinct personality, finally giving up oneself – being merged and, therefore, killed; and Ken, ultimately, returning consciousness with entirety of his dire past but in robust conviction.
